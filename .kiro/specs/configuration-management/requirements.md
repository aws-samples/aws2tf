# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The aws2tf project currently uses a global variables approach via `globals.py` that creates tight coupling, makes testing difficult, and reduces code maintainability. Additionally, the core aws2tf functionality for resource discovery, dependency management, and terraform import operations needs to be fully implemented with the new architecture.

This feature will:
1. Replace the global variables pattern with a proper configuration management system that provides better encapsulation, testability, and maintainability
2. Implement the complete aws2tf functionality including resource discovery, dependency checking, terraform import operations, and configuration file generation
3. Provide a robust command-line interface and workflow orchestration for importing AWS infrastructure into terraform

The implementation will preserve all existing functionality while adding the missing core features needed for a complete aws2tf tool.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized configuration system that manages application state without global variables, so that the code is more maintainable and testable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize a configuration manager that replaces all global variable functionality
2. WHEN configuration values are accessed THEN the system SHALL provide type-safe access to configuration parameters
3. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing functionality without behavioral changes
4. WHEN tests are written THEN the system SHALL allow easy mocking and isolation of configuration state

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want runtime configuration management that handles command-line arguments and AWS credentials, so that the application can be configured dynamically without global state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN command-line arguments are parsed THEN the system SHALL populate the configuration manager with user-provided values
2. WHEN AWS credentials are detected THEN the system SHALL store credential information in the configuration manager
3. WHEN configuration values change during execution THEN the system SHALL update the configuration manager state safely
4. WHEN multiple threads access configuration THEN the system SHALL provide thread-safe access to configuration data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want dependency injection for configuration access, so that modules can receive configuration without importing global state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN modules need configuration data THEN the system SHALL provide configuration through dependency injection
2. WHEN functions are called THEN the system SHALL pass configuration objects as parameters instead of accessing globals
3. WHEN new modules are added THEN the system SHALL allow easy access to configuration without global imports
4. WHEN refactoring code THEN the system SHALL make dependencies explicit and traceable

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want organized configuration categories that group related settings, so that configuration is well-structured and easy to understand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration is organized THEN the system SHALL group related settings into logical categories (AWS, Debug, Processing, etc.)
2. WHEN accessing configuration THEN the system SHALL provide clear namespacing for different configuration domains
3. WHEN adding new configuration THEN the system SHALL allow easy extension of configuration categories
4. WHEN validating configuration THEN the system SHALL ensure configuration values meet expected constraints

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing support for the configuration system, so that I can write reliable unit tests and integration tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing unit tests THEN the system SHALL allow easy creation of test configuration instances
2. WHEN mocking configuration THEN the system SHALL provide interfaces that can be easily mocked
3. WHEN running tests in parallel THEN the system SHALL ensure test isolation without shared global state
4. WHEN testing different scenarios THEN the system SHALL allow easy setup of different configuration states

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want backward compatibility during the migration, so that the transition from globals can be done incrementally without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating from globals THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing public interfaces during transition
2. WHEN legacy code accesses globals THEN the system SHALL provide compatibility shims where necessary
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL remove all global variable dependencies
4. WHEN validating the migration THEN the system SHALL ensure no functional regressions occur

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want aws2tf to discover AWS resources and their dependencies automatically, so that I can import complete infrastructure into terraform without manual dependency tracking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I specify a target resource THEN the system SHALL discover all dependent resources automatically
2. WHEN resources have circular dependencies THEN the system SHALL detect and resolve them appropriately
3. WHEN discovering resources THEN the system SHALL respect AWS API rate limits and handle errors gracefully
4. WHEN resource discovery is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a complete dependency map for terraform import

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want aws2tf to generate and execute terraform import commands for discovered resources, so that I can bring existing AWS infrastructure under terraform management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN resources are discovered THEN the system SHALL generate correct terraform import commands for each resource
2. WHEN executing imports THEN the system SHALL handle terraform state management safely
3. WHEN imports fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and rollback capabilities
4. WHEN imports succeed THEN the system SHALL validate that terraform state matches AWS resources

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want aws2tf to generate terraform configuration files for imported resources, so that I have working terraform code for my existing infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN resources are imported THEN the system SHALL generate corresponding terraform configuration files
2. WHEN generating configurations THEN the system SHALL include proper resource dependencies and references
3. WHEN configuration files are created THEN the system SHALL organize them logically and follow terraform best practices
4. WHEN configurations are complete THEN the system SHALL validate that terraform plan shows no changes

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user, I want a complete command-line interface for aws2tf operations, so that I can easily import AWS infrastructure with appropriate options and controls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run aws2tf THEN the system SHALL provide clear command-line options for all operations
2. WHEN operations are running THEN the system SHALL show progress and status information
3. WHEN I use dry-run mode THEN the system SHALL show what would be done without executing changes
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages and recovery suggestions
